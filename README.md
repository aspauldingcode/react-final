# Final Project - Promineo Tech Front-End Stack Dev

Want to test it out? Preview on any device via [GitHub Pages](https://aspauldingcode.github.io/react-final/)!

## Here, I create my last project for my Front-End Stack Development Course

**My Final Guidelines:**

- Working CRUD Features
- Implement 1 or more APIs
- 3 Pages
- React Router Page Routing
- React Bootstrap Styling
- 10 React Components

> Only 6 Components are at play at the moment. I planned CRUD Operations to work with seperate components for Create, Read. Update, and Delete.
> All functions are currently all built inside of CrudAPI.js Component, as I haven't yet split them to seperate Crud.js Components.

### Mobile-Friendly Design

I built my final with a responsive design. Visit my final on mobile, or on computer. It should render correctly.

#### ColorHunt Background

I ported COLORHUNT's "ColorTab" Google Chrome extention! for use with my Final's background.
Each time you reload the page, the background reloads a different color pallete.
Find ColorTab here:
